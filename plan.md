# Cloudflare AI Gateway Integration Project

## Current Goal
Enable inline image generation in chat conversations using LLM tool calling to automatically generate and display images based on chat context.

---

## Phase 1: Cloudflare AI Gateway for Multiple LLMs ‚úÖ
- [x] Update ChatState to support multiple LLM models (Llama 3.1, Llama 2, Mistral)
- [x] Replace Anthropic client with direct HTTP requests to Cloudflare AI Gateway Workers AI endpoint
- [x] Add model selection UI component in chat page header (dropdown selector)
- [x] Update streaming logic to work with Cloudflare Workers AI SSE streaming format
- [x] Test LLM chat completions with different models (all 3 models tested successfully)

---

## Phase 2: Image Generation with Multiple Models ‚úÖ
- [x] Create new ImageGenerationState for handling image generation
- [x] Add image model selection UI (Stable Diffusion XL Lightning, Flux-1-Schnell)
- [x] Implement image generation API calls to Cloudflare Workers AI
- [x] Create image display component with download capability
- [x] Add image generation page/section with prompt input and model selector
- [x] Test image generation with multiple models (both models tested successfully)

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced UI for Image Gallery ‚úÖ
- [x] Create image gallery page to display generated images (already implemented in Phase 2)
- [x] Add image history tracking in state (already implemented)
- [x] Implement grid layout for displaying multiple generated images (already implemented)
- [x] Add image regeneration with same/modified prompts (user can enter new prompts)
- [x] Add navigation between chat and image generation features (back button and suggestion chip)
- [x] Test complete user flow for chat and image generation

---

## Phase 4: Debug and Refactor Chat Streaming ‚úÖ
- [x] Debug TypeError in streaming concatenation (None type error)
- [x] Refactor streaming logic to use accumulator pattern instead of direct message mutation
- [x] Add comprehensive null checks throughout streaming code
- [x] Simplify async state updates for better reliability
- [x] Test refactored streaming logic to ensure no None errors
- [x] Verify UI functionality after refactoring
- [x] Fix remaining None concatenation edge case with additional null check
- [x] Fix JSON decoding error caused by empty arrays in SSE stream
- [x] Add type validation to ensure parsed JSON is a dict before accessing

---

## Phase 5: Tool Use for Inline Image Generation ‚úÖ
- [x] Add tool/function definitions to chat API requests (image_generation tool)
- [x] Update Message TypedDict to support image content alongside text
- [x] Modify streaming logic to detect and handle tool_calls in LLM responses
- [x] Implement tool execution handler that calls image generation API
- [x] Update chat message bubble component to display inline images
- [x] Test complete flow: chat ‚Üí tool call ‚Üí image generation ‚Üí display in chat

---

## Phase 6: Enhanced Tool Use UI
- [ ] Add visual indicators for tool use (loading state for image generation)
- [ ] Display tool call reasoning/context in chat bubble
- [ ] Add retry/regenerate capability for failed image generations
- [ ] Implement error handling for tool execution failures
- [ ] Test edge cases (multiple tools, failed generations, network errors)

## Notes
- ‚úÖ Using Cloudflare AI Gateway endpoint: `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/workers-ai/{model}`
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured: CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID, CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY, CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN
- ‚úÖ Working LLM models: Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, Llama 2 7B Chat, Mistral 7B Instruct
- ‚úÖ Streaming format: Server-Sent Events (SSE) with `data: {"response":"..."}\n\n` format
- ‚úÖ Working image models: Stable Diffusion XL Lightning (PNG binary), Flux-1 Schnell (JSON with base64)
- ‚úÖ Tool calling implemented with generate_image function
- ‚úÖ Chat messages support inline image display with image_b64 field
- üîÑ **Next**: Enhance tool use UI with better visual feedback and error handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Cloudflare Workers AI tool use support is working - tool_calls are returned in SSE stream
