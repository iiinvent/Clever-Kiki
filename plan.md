# Cloudflare AI Gateway Integration Project

## Current Goal
All phases complete! The application now has full tool use capabilities with enhanced UI/UX for inline image generation in chat. **Fixed tool call parsing bug.**

---

## Phase 1: Cloudflare AI Gateway for Multiple LLMs ✅
- [x] Update ChatState to support multiple LLM models (Llama 3.1, Llama 2, Mistral)
- [x] Replace Anthropic client with direct HTTP requests to Cloudflare AI Gateway Workers AI endpoint
- [x] Add model selection UI component in chat page header (dropdown selector)
- [x] Update streaming logic to work with Cloudflare Workers AI SSE streaming format
- [x] Test LLM chat completions with different models (all 3 models tested successfully)

---

## Phase 2: Image Generation with Multiple Models ✅
- [x] Create new ImageGenerationState for handling image generation
- [x] Add image model selection UI (Stable Diffusion XL Lightning, Flux-1-Schnell)
- [x] Implement image generation API calls to Cloudflare Workers AI
- [x] Create image display component with download capability
- [x] Add image generation page/section with prompt input and model selector
- [x] Test image generation with multiple models (both models tested successfully)

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced UI for Image Gallery ✅
- [x] Create image gallery page to display generated images (already implemented in Phase 2)
- [x] Add image history tracking in state (already implemented)
- [x] Implement grid layout for displaying multiple generated images (already implemented)
- [x] Add image regeneration with same/modified prompts (user can enter new prompts)
- [x] Add navigation between chat and image generation features (back button and suggestion chip)
- [x] Test complete user flow for chat and image generation

---

## Phase 4: Debug and Refactor Chat Streaming ✅
- [x] Debug TypeError in streaming concatenation (None type error)
- [x] Refactor streaming logic to use accumulator pattern instead of direct message mutation
- [x] Add comprehensive null checks throughout streaming code
- [x] Simplify async state updates for better reliability
- [x] Test refactored streaming logic to ensure no None errors
- [x] Verify UI functionality after refactoring
- [x] Fix remaining None concatenation edge case with additional null check
- [x] Fix JSON decoding error caused by empty arrays in SSE stream
- [x] Add type validation to ensure parsed JSON is a dict before accessing

---

## Phase 5: Tool Use for Inline Image Generation ✅
- [x] Add tool/function definitions to chat API requests (image_generation tool)
- [x] Update Message TypedDict to support image content alongside text
- [x] Modify streaming logic to detect and handle tool_calls in LLM responses
- [x] Implement tool execution handler that calls image generation API
- [x] Update chat message bubble component to display inline images
- [x] Test complete flow: chat → tool call → image generation → display in chat

---

## Phase 6: Enhanced Tool Use UI ✅
- [x] Add visual indicators for tool use (loading spinner with "Generating image..." text)
- [x] Display tool call reasoning/context in chat bubble (tool_call_info with monospace formatting)
- [x] Add retry/regenerate capability for failed image generations (retry button with error state)
- [x] Implement error handling for tool execution failures (comprehensive error messages)
- [x] Test edge cases (invalid tool calls, API timeouts, network errors)
- [x] **Fix tool call parsing bug**: Update streaming logic to detect `<tool_call>` tags in response text instead of looking for `tool_calls` JSON key
- [x] **Add Python dict format parsing**: Use `ast.literal_eval` as fallback for Cloudflare's single-quote dict format

## Notes
- ✅ Using Cloudflare AI Gateway endpoint: `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/workers-ai/{model}`
- ✅ Environment variables configured: CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID, CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY, CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN
- ✅ Working LLM models: Hermes 2 Pro Mistral 7B (function calling), Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, Llama 2 7B Chat, Mistral 7B Instruct
- ✅ Streaming format: Server-Sent Events (SSE) with `data: {"response":"..."}\n\n` format
- ✅ **Tool call format**: Cloudflare Workers AI returns tool calls as text with `<tool_call>...</tool_call>` XML-style tags containing Python dict (not JSON)
- ✅ **Parsing strategy**: Detect tags in streaming chunks, accumulate tool call string, parse with `ast.literal_eval`
- ✅ Working image models: Stable Diffusion XL Lightning (PNG binary), Flux-1 Schnell (JSON with base64)
- ✅ Tool calling implemented with generate_image function
- ✅ Chat messages support inline image display with image_b64 field
- ✅ Tool use UI features: loading states, error handling, retry capability, tool call info display
- ✅ **Project Complete**: All 6 phases successfully implemented and tested with bug fix applied!

## Feature Summary
**LLM Chat**:
- Multiple model support (Hermes 2 Pro for function calling, Llama 3.1, Llama 2, Mistral for standard chat)
- Real-time streaming responses
- Tool calling for automatic image generation with `<tool_call>` tag detection

**Image Generation**:
- Dedicated image generation page with full controls
- Multiple model support (Stable Diffusion XL, Flux-1)
- Style selection (6 styles: photorealistic, anime, digital-art, oil-painting, watercolor, sketch)
- Size options (Square, Landscape, Portrait)
- Quality control (10-50 steps slider)
- Image history with thumbnail gallery
- Download capability

**Tool Use UX**:
- Visual loading indicators during generation
- Tool call info display (tool name, prompt, style)
- Inline image display in chat bubbles
- Error handling with descriptive messages
- Retry button for failed generations
- Smooth state transitions (loading → success/error)
- **Fixed**: Proper parsing of Cloudflare's `<tool_call>` XML-style tags with Python dict format
