# Cloudflare AI Gateway Integration Project

## Current Goal
Integrate Cloudflare AI Gateway for LLM chat completions and add image generation capabilities with multiple model options.

---

## Phase 1: Cloudflare AI Gateway for Multiple LLMs ✅
- [x] Update ChatState to support multiple LLM models (Llama 3.1, Llama 2, Mistral)
- [x] Replace Anthropic client with direct HTTP requests to Cloudflare AI Gateway Workers AI endpoint
- [x] Add model selection UI component in chat page header (dropdown selector)
- [x] Update streaming logic to work with Cloudflare Workers AI SSE streaming format
- [x] Test LLM chat completions with different models (all 3 models tested successfully)

**Completed**: Successfully integrated Cloudflare AI Gateway with Workers AI models. Users can now select from 3 different LLM models (Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, Llama 2 7B Chat, Mistral 7B Instruct) and chat with streaming responses.

---

## Phase 2: Image Generation with Multiple Models ✅
- [x] Create new ImageGenerationState for handling image generation
- [x] Add image model selection UI (Stable Diffusion XL Lightning, Flux-1-Schnell)
- [x] Implement image generation API calls to Cloudflare Workers AI
- [x] Create image display component with download capability
- [x] Add image generation page/section with prompt input and model selector
- [x] Test image generation with multiple models (both models tested successfully)

**Completed**: Successfully implemented image generation with Cloudflare Workers AI. Users can generate images using Stable Diffusion XL Lightning (returns PNG) or Flux-1 Schnell (returns JSON with base64). Images are displayed with download buttons and stored in history.

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced UI for Image Gallery ✅
- [x] Create image gallery page to display generated images (already implemented in Phase 2)
- [x] Add image history tracking in state (already implemented)
- [x] Implement grid layout for displaying multiple generated images (already implemented)
- [x] Add image regeneration with same/modified prompts (user can enter new prompts)
- [x] Add navigation between chat and image generation features (back button and suggestion chip)
- [x] Test complete user flow for chat and image generation

**Completed**: Image gallery features were already implemented during Phase 2. The image generation page includes a history grid that displays all generated images with their prompts, a responsive grid layout, and navigation between home/chat/image pages.

## Phase 4: Debug and Refactor Chat Streaming ✅
- [x] Debug TypeError in streaming concatenation (None type error)
- [x] Refactor streaming logic to use accumulator pattern instead of direct message mutation
- [x] Add comprehensive null checks throughout streaming code
- [x] Simplify async state updates for better reliability
- [x] Test refactored streaming logic to ensure no None errors
- [x] Verify UI functionality after refactoring
- [x] Fix remaining None concatenation edge case with additional null check
- [x] Fix JSON decoding error caused by empty arrays in SSE stream
- [x] Add type validation to ensure parsed JSON is a dict before accessing

**Completed**: Successfully fixed all streaming errors including JSON parsing issues.

**Key improvements:**
- Accumulator pattern: Chunks are accumulated in a local variable before updating state
- Atomic updates: Message content is set in one operation within `async with self:` blocks
- Null safety: Added `text_chunk or ""` pattern to convert None to empty string before concatenation
- **JSON parsing robustness**: Added `.strip()` to remove whitespace, check for empty/[DONE] markers, and validate JSON is a dict
- **Type validation**: Added `isinstance(json_data, dict)` check before calling `.get()` to handle arrays like `[]`
- Better error handling: `continue` on JSON errors instead of breaking the stream
- Simplified logic: Removed complex nested state access patterns

**Root cause fixed**: Cloudflare AI Gateway occasionally sends `data: []` (empty arrays) in the SSE stream, which when parsed becomes a Python list, not a dict. This caused the "Expecting value: line 1 column 2 (char 1)" error. The fix validates JSON type before accessing dict methods.

## Notes
- ✅ Using Cloudflare AI Gateway endpoint: `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/workers-ai/{model}`
- ✅ Environment variables configured: CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID, CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY, CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN
- ✅ Working LLM models: Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, Llama 2 7B Chat, Mistral 7B Instruct
- ✅ Streaming format: Server-Sent Events (SSE) with `data: {"response":"..."}\n\n` format
- ✅ Working image models: Stable Diffusion XL Lightning (PNG binary), Flux-1 Schnell (JSON with base64)
- ✅ Images stored with prompts, timestamps, and base64 data for display and download
- ✅ Complete navigation flow: Home → Chat or Generate Images → History grid
- ✅ **Streaming fully debugged**: Handles None chunks, empty arrays `[]`, [DONE] markers, and non-dict JSON responses
- ✅ **All backend errors resolved**: Chat streaming is production-ready with comprehensive error handling
